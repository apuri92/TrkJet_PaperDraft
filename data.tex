The \PbPb\ and \pp\ data used in this analysis were recorded in 2015.
 The data samples consist of 25~pb$^{-1}$ of \sqrts~=~5.02~\TeV\ \pp\ data and 0.49~nb$^{-1}$ of \sqrtsnn~=~5.02~\TeV\
\pbpb\ data. The MB
\PbPb\ sample was recorded with different pre-scales\footnote{The pre-scale indicates which fraction of events that passed the trigger selection was selected for recording by the data  acquisition.}  depending on the instantaneous luminosity in the
LHC fill. The MB trigger recorded an effective luminosity of 22 $\mu$b$^{-1}$.
In \pbpb\ and \pp\ collisions, events are required to have a reconstructed vertex
within 150~mm of the nominal interaction point along the beam axis.
Only events taken during stable beam conditions and satisfying detector and data-quality requirements that include the calorimeters and inner tracking detectors being in nominal operating conditions are considered. 

A sample of 1.8~$\times10^{7}$ simulated 5.02~\TeV\ \powheg{}+\pythiaeight~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Sjostrand:2014zea} \pp\ hard-scattering events, generated using the A14 tune~\cite{ATLAS2014021} and the NNPDF23LO PDF set~\cite{Ball:2012cx}, is used to evaluate the performance for measuring \Dptr\ distributions in the \pp\ data. The performance of the detector and analysis procedure in \PbPb\ collisions is evaluated using 1.8~$\times10^{7}$ 5.02~\TeV\ hard-scattering dijet events generated with \powheg{}+\pythiaeight\ overlaid on top of events from the enhanced minimum-bias \PbPb\ data sample. In both samples, the detector response is simulated using \textsc{Geant}4~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh,Aad:2010ah}.

In \PbPb\ collisions, the event centrality reflects the overlap area of the two colliding nuclei and is characterized by \ETfcal, the total transverse energy deposited in the 
FCal~\cite{Aaboud:2017tql}. The six centrality intervals used in this analysis are defined according to successive percentiles of the \ETfcal\ distribution obtained in minimum-bias collisions, ordered from the most central (highest \ETfcal) to the most peripheral (lowest \ETfcal) collisions: 0--10\%, 10--20\%, 20--30\%, 30--40\%, 40--60\%, 60--80\%. A weight is assigned to each MC event such that the event sample obtained from the simulation has the same \ETfcal\ distribution as in data.
