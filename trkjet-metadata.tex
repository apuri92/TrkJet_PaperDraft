\AtlasAbstract{%
Studies of the fragmentation of jets into charged particles in heavy-ion collisions can provide information about the mechanism of jet quenching by the hot and dense QCD matter created in such collisions, the quark-gluon plasma.
This paper presents a measurement of the angular distribution of charged particles around the jet axis in $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$~5.02~\TeV\ Pb+Pb and \textit{pp} collisions, done using the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
The measurement is performed for jets reconstructed with the \antikt\ algorithm with radius parameter $R = $~0.4, and is extended to a distance of $r= 0.8$ from the jet axis.
Results are presented as a function of Pb+Pb collision centrality and distance from the jet axis for charged particles with transverse momenta in the \mbox{1--63 GeV} range, associated to jets with transverse momenta in the \mbox{126--316 GeV} range within an absolute value of jet rapidity of less than 1.7.
Modifications to the measured distributions are quantified by taking a ratio to the baseline measurements in \pp\ collisions.
Yields of charged particles with transverse momenta below 4 GeV are observed to be increasingly enhanced as a function of angular distance from the jet axis, achieving a maximum at $r=0.6$.
Charged particles with transverse momenta above \mbox{4 GeV} have an enhanced yield in Pb+Pb collisions in the jet core for angular distances up to $r = 0.05$ from the jet axis, with a suppression at all larger distances.}
