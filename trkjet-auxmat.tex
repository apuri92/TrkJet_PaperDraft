%In an ATLAS paper, auxiliary plots and tables that are supposed to be made public 
%should be collected in an appendix that has the title \enquote{Auxiliary material}.
%This information will appear on the public webpage, but will not be included
%in the document submitted to arXiv and to the journal.
